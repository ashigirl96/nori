# nori agent notes

## Initial setup

Run the setup script to initialize submodules and build GhosttyKit:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

## Local dev

After making code changes, run the reload script to build the Debug app:

```bash
./scripts/reload.sh           # build only; prints `App path:` for cmd-click
./scripts/reload.sh --launch  # build, quit any running instance, then open
```

The build is pinned to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/GhosttyTabs`. Output is `nori DEV.app` (Debug configuration, bundle ID `com.nori.app.debug`, socket `/tmp/nori-debug.sock`). Bundle ID and socket are isolated from any production `/Applications/nori.app`, so the dev build can coexist with it.

`reload.sh` prints an `App path:` line with the absolute path to the built `.app`. Use that path to build a cmd-clickable `file://` URL. Steps:

1. Grab the path from the `App path:` line in `reload.sh` output.
2. Prepend `file://` and URL-encode spaces as `%20`. Do not hardcode any part of the path.
3. Format it as a markdown link using the template for your agent type.

**Claude Code** outputs:
```markdown
=======================================================
[nori DEV.app](file:///Users/someone/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/GhosttyTabs/Build/Products/Debug/nori%20DEV.app)
=======================================================
```

**Codex** outputs:
```
=======================================================
[nori DEV.app: file:///Users/someone/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/GhosttyTabs/Build/Products/Debug/nori%20DEV.app](file:///Users/someone/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/GhosttyTabs/Build/Products/Debug/nori%20DEV.app)
=======================================================
```

If you only need to verify the build compiles (no launch), `./scripts/reload.sh` without `--launch` is the right call.

When rebuilding GhosttyKit.xcframework, always use Release optimizations:

```bash
cd ghostty && zig build -Demit-xcframework=true -Dxcframework-target=universal -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

`reload.sh` automatically rebuilds `norid` (ReleaseFast) and copies it into the bundle.

## Install over `/Applications/nori.app`

When you want to replace the production install with a local Release build of
this fork:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh           # build Release + copy to /Applications/nori.app
./scripts/install.sh --launch  # build, install, then open
```

This builds `nori.app` under the Release configuration (bundle ID
`com.nori.app`, `PRODUCT_NAME=nori`), quits any running production
instance, removes the existing `/Applications/nori.app`, and copies the new
bundle in place. Debug `nori DEV.app` builds from `reload.sh` are unaffected
because they use a distinct bundle ID (`com.nori.app.debug`).

Use `reload.sh` for iterative dev (Debug, fast feedback). Use `install.sh`
when you actually want to ship the fork as your daily driver.

## Debug event log

All debug events (keys, mouse, focus, splits, tabs) go to `/tmp/nori-debug.log` in DEBUG builds:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/nori-debug.log
```

- Implementation: `vendor/bonsplit/Sources/Bonsplit/Public/DebugEventLog.swift`
- Free function `dlog("message")` — logs with timestamp and appends to file in real time
- Entire file is `#if DEBUG`; all call sites must be wrapped in `#if DEBUG` / `#endif`
- 500-entry ring buffer; `DebugEventLog.shared.dump()` writes full buffer to file
- Key events logged in `AppDelegate.swift` (monitor, performKeyEquivalent)
- Mouse/UI events logged inline in views (ContentView, BrowserPanelView, etc.)
- Focus events: `focus.panel`, `focus.bonsplit`, `focus.firstResponder`, `focus.moveFocus`
- Bonsplit events: `tab.select`, `tab.close`, `tab.dragStart`, `tab.drop`, `pane.focus`, `pane.drop`, `divider.dragStart`

## Regression test commit policy

When adding a regression test for a bug fix, use a two-commit structure so CI proves the test catches the bug:

1. **Commit 1:** Add the failing test only (no fix). CI should go red.
2. **Commit 2:** Add the fix. CI should go green.

This makes it visible in the GitHub PR UI (Commits tab, check statuses) that the test genuinely fails without the fix.

## Debug menu

The app has a **Debug** menu in the macOS menu bar (only in DEBUG builds). Use it for visual iteration:

- **Debug > Debug Windows** contains panels for tuning layout, colors, and behavior. Entries are alphabetical with no dividers.
- To add a debug toggle or visual option: create an `NSWindowController` subclass with a `shared` singleton, add it to the "Debug Windows" menu in `Sources/noriApp.swift`, and add a SwiftUI view with `@AppStorage` bindings for live changes.
- When the user says "debug menu" or "debug window", they mean this menu, not `defaults write`.

## Pitfalls

- **Custom UTTypes** for drag-and-drop must be declared in `Resources/Info.plist` under `UTExportedTypeDeclarations` (e.g. `com.splittabbar.tabtransfer`, `com.nori.sidebar-tab-reorder`).
- Do not add an app-level display link or manual `ghostty_surface_draw` loop; rely on Ghostty wakeups/renderer to avoid typing lag.
- **Typing-latency-sensitive paths** (read carefully before touching these areas):
  - `WindowTerminalHostView.hitTest()` in `TerminalWindowPortal.swift`: called on every event including keyboard. All divider/sidebar/drag routing is gated to pointer events only. Do not add work outside the `isPointerEvent` guard.
  - `TabItemView` in `ContentView.swift`: uses `Equatable` conformance + `.equatable()` to skip body re-evaluation during typing. Do not add `@EnvironmentObject`, `@ObservedObject` (besides `tab`), or `@Binding` properties without updating the `==` function. Do not remove `.equatable()` from the ForEach call site. Do not read `tabManager` or `notificationStore` in the body; use the precomputed `let` parameters instead.
  - `TerminalSurface.forceRefresh()` in `GhosttyTerminalView.swift`: called on every keystroke. Do not add allocations, file I/O, or formatting here.
- **Terminal find layering contract:** `SurfaceSearchOverlay` must be mounted from `GhosttySurfaceScrollView` in `Sources/GhosttyTerminalView.swift` (AppKit portal layer), not from SwiftUI panel containers such as `Sources/Panels/TerminalPanelView.swift`. Portal-hosted terminal views can sit above SwiftUI during split/workspace churn.
- **Submodule safety:** When modifying a submodule (ghostty, vendor/bonsplit, etc.), always push the submodule commit to its remote `main` branch BEFORE committing the updated pointer in the parent repo. Never commit on a detached HEAD or temporary branch — the commit will be orphaned and lost. Verify with: `cd <submodule> && git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main`.
- **All user-facing strings must be localized.** Use `String(localized: "key.name", defaultValue: "English text")` for every string shown in the UI (labels, buttons, menus, dialogs, tooltips, error messages). Keys go in `Resources/Localizable.xcstrings` with translations for all supported languages (currently English and Japanese). Never use bare string literals in SwiftUI `Text()`, `Button()`, alert titles, etc.
- **Shortcut policy:** Every new nori-owned keyboard shortcut must be added to `KeyboardShortcutSettings`, visible/editable in Settings, supported in `~/.config/nori/settings.json`, and documented in the keyboard shortcut and configuration docs.

## Test quality policy

- Do not add tests that only verify source code text, method signatures, AST fragments, or grep-style patterns.
- Do not add tests that read checked-in metadata or project files such as `Resources/Info.plist`, `project.pbxproj`, `.xcconfig`, or source files only to assert that a key, string, plist entry, or snippet exists.
- Tests must verify observable runtime behavior through executable paths (unit/integration/e2e/CLI), not implementation shape.
- For metadata changes, prefer verifying the built app bundle or the runtime behavior that depends on that metadata, not the checked-in source file.
- If a behavior cannot be exercised end-to-end yet, add a small runtime seam or harness first, then test through that seam.
- If no meaningful behavioral or artifact-level test is practical, skip the fake regression test and state that explicitly.

## Socket command threading policy

- Do not use `DispatchQueue.main.sync` for high-frequency socket telemetry commands (`report_*`, `ports_kick`, status/progress/log metadata updates).
- For telemetry hot paths:
  - Parse and validate arguments off-main.
  - Dedupe/coalesce off-main first.
  - Schedule minimal UI/model mutation with `DispatchQueue.main.async` only when needed.
- Commands that directly manipulate AppKit/Ghostty UI state (focus/select/open/close/send key/input, list/current queries requiring exact synchronous snapshot) are allowed to run on main actor.
- If adding a new socket command, default to off-main handling; require an explicit reason in code comments when main-thread execution is necessary.

## Socket focus policy

- Socket/CLI commands must not steal macOS app focus (no app activation/window raising side effects).
- Only explicit focus-intent commands may mutate in-app focus/selection (`window.focus`, `workspace.select/next/previous/last`, `surface.focus`, `pane.focus/last`, browser focus commands, and v1 focus equivalents).
- All non-focus commands should preserve current user focus context while still applying data/model changes.

## Testing policy

**Never run tests locally.** All tests (E2E, UI, python socket tests) run via GitHub Actions or on the VM.

- **E2E / UI tests:** trigger via `gh workflow run test-e2e.yml` (see noriterm-hq CLAUDE.md for details)
- **Unit tests:** `xcodebuild -scheme nori-unit` is safe (no app launch), but prefer CI
- **Python socket tests (tests_v2/):** these connect to a running nori instance's socket. If you must test locally, point them at the dev build's socket (`/tmp/nori-debug.sock`) with `NORI_SOCKET=/tmp/nori-debug.sock`.

## Ghostty submodule workflow

Ghostty changes must be committed in the `ghostty` submodule and pushed to the `manaflow-ai/ghostty` fork.
Keep `docs/ghostty-fork.md` up to date with any fork changes and conflict notes.

```bash
cd ghostty
git remote -v  # origin = upstream, manaflow = fork
git checkout -b <branch>
git add <files>
git commit -m "..."
git push manaflow <branch>
```

To keep the fork up to date with upstream:

```bash
cd ghostty
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git merge origin/main
git push manaflow main
```

Then update the parent repo with the new submodule SHA:

```bash
cd ..
git add ghostty
git commit -m "Update ghostty submodule"
```
